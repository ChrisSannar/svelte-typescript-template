# svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/will-wow/svelte-typescript-template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit will-wow/svelte-typescript-template
cd svelte-app
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
yarn install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Deploying to the web

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public
```
